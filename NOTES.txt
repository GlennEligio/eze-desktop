notes:
1. TransactionBorrow_FormClosed() eventhandler function exist in both TransactionReturn and TransactionBorrow Form classes
	> seems to be not the problem, since no reference is made for to the TransactionReturn form's TransactionBorrow method
2. Methods implemented from DPFP.Capture.EventHandler on TransactionBorrow and TransactionReturn form have fully qualified package name
	> compare to Start Form with only have the method names
3. Timer for GSM poll in the TransactionBorrow is not properly disposed

	> call Timer.Stop(), or comment out the line where we called Timer.Start()
4. Inside the Process()'s foreach loop, second if statement where it checks if result.Verified is true, the StartForm calls the Stop(), while TransactionBorrow and TransactionReturn not calls it
